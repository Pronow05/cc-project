# University Administration Microservices

This project implements two independent but integrated microservices for a university administration website:

1. **University Budgeting**: Handles allocation and tracking of funds for university departments
2. **Interdepartmental Communication**: Facilitates messaging between university departments

## Architecture

The system uses:
- Python backend with Streamlit for frontend UI
- SQLite for databases
- Docker for containerization
- Flask for API endpoints

## Microservices

### Budgeting Service (Port 8501)

This service manages:
- Departmental hierarchies (e.g., BTech â†’ CSE)
- Fiscal years
- Budget categories
- Fund allocations
- Expenditure tracking
- User authentication

The budgeting service acts as the source of truth for Department definitions and User authentication.

#### API Endpoints:
- `GET /api/departments`: Returns a list of all departments
- `POST /api/authenticate`: Authenticates users

### Communication Service (Port 8502)

This service enables:
- Sending messages between departments
- Viewing received messages
- Maintaining message history

The communication service relies on the budgeting service for:
- Department information
- User authentication

## Data Models

### Budgeting Service
- **Departments**: Hierarchical structure of university departments
- **Users**: Authentication and department association
- **FiscalYears**: Budget periods
- **BudgetCategories**: Types of budget allocations
- **Allocations**: Budget amounts per department, category, and fiscal year
- **Expenditures**: Spending against allocations

### Communication Service
- **Messages**: Sent messages with subject, body, sender, timestamp
- **MessageRecipients**: Message recipients (supports multiple recipients)

## Running the Application

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose

### Steps
1. Clone the repository
2. Run the application:
   ```
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
3. Access the services:
   - Budgeting: http://localhost:8501
   - Communication: http://localhost:8502

### Default Users
- **Admin**: Username: `admin`, Password: `admin123`, Department: Administration
- **User1**: Username: `user1`, Password: `pass123`, Department: CSE
- **User2**: Username: `user2`, Password: `pass123`, Department: AI

## Demo Workflow

1. Log in to the budgeting service and set up departments, fiscal years, and budget categories
2. Allocate funds to departments
3. Record expenditures against allocations
4. View department budget summaries
5. Log in to the communication service
6. Send messages between departments
7. View received messages in your department's inbox
